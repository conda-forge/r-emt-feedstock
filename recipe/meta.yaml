  summary: The package provides functions to carry out a Goodness-of-fit test for discrete multivariate data. It is tested if a given observation is likely to have occurred under the assumption of an ab-initio model. A p-value can be calculated using different distance measures between observed and expected frequencies.
    A Monte Carlo method is provided to make the package capable of solving high-dimensional problems.
